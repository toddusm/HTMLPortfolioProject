    <h3>Learn More About Me</h3>
    <p>In the summer of 2015 I was lucky enough to go to DevMountain to start my path on the road to progaming. I had just recelenty been laid off as a software QA 
      manager at a local start up. Going to DevMountain I wanted to expand and enhance my ability as a QA manager as well as learn the art of coding. I love front development and learning
      new languages. Currently I am profiecnt in MEAN stack development.
